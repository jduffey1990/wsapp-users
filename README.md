## 🐳 Docker

If you're running this as part of a full-stack app:

- Make sure `docker-compose.yml` includes the correct service and MongoDB configuration.  Locally, `docker-compose.yml` is necessary to map the ports properly versus the self-contained microservices in production

'''
version: "3.8"
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:8
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

  users:
    build: ./users
    env_file:
      - ./users/.env
    container_name: services-users
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    depends_on:

  brackets:
    build: ./brackets
    env_file:

    container_name: services-brackets
